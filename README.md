App Created for practicing the manipulation of JSON objects data

    #Conclusion
    Dealing with complex JSON responses is a necessity today to React developers. It can be tedious at times but isn't a difficult task altogether if done wisely by breaking down large pieces of data into smaller chunks. This can be done by properly observing how an endpoint is giving back data to the frontend, especially the name of the keys, the type of values returned, etc. Working with complex JSON responses also improves your debugging skills.
